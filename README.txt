RUNNING THE PROJECT

We opened the file game.html in chrome using the
--allow-file-access-from-files option.


SUMMARY OF PROJECT

We implemented a first-person shooter game where you shoot
enemies to increase your score until your health is negative.

The first screen is a menu that shows start, options, and rules.
You can switch between these options by using the up and down
keys. Hit enter to select.

During the game, you can shift the navigation of enemies by
moving the mouse around the canvas. Clicking will fire a bullet
from the gun, and hitting the 's' key will throw a grenade into
the field. Both these actions are accompanied by a sound.

When your health is 0 or below, a screen appears showing a
message with your final score.

ADVANCED TOPICS

1)BUMP MAPPING
	Normal mapping is applied to the floor of the environment.

2)PHYSICS
	Physics is used to determine the trajectory of the
	grenade.

3)COLLISION DETECTION
	We used collision detection to determine when the
	grenade should bounce and to prevent enemies from
	running into each other.
